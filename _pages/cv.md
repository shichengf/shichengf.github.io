  * Advisor: Prof. Lu Cheng; Co-advisor: Prof. Kun Zhang (CMU)
  * Research: Causal Representation Learning, LLM Factuality Alignment, AI for Science
* **B.Eng. in Automation (Control & Robotics)**, Zhejiang University, Chu Kochen Honors College, 2021 – 2025
  * GPA: 3.98/4.0, Rank: 6/121 (Top 5%), Outstanding Graduate

## Publications

* **Shicheng Fan**, Kun Zhang, Lu Cheng. "TRACE: Trajectory Recovery for Continuous Mechanism Evolution in Causal Representation Learning." *Under Review*, arXiv:2601.21135
* Hanyu Su, **Shicheng Fan**, Yifan Cui, Lu Cheng. "Conformalized Proximal Causal Inference with a Single Proxy." *Under Review*

## Research Experience

* **TRACE: CRL under Continuous Mechanism Evolution** · *First Author* · 2025–2026
  * Proposed the first theoretical framework extending causal representation learning from discrete mechanism shifts to continuous transitions; proved joint identifiability via nonlinear ICA and variational inference
  * Designed the TRACE framework based on Mixture-of-Experts, recovering mechanism trajectories via time-varying mixture coefficients, generalizable to unseen intermediate states

* **QuCo-RL: Knowledge-Enhanced RL for LLM Anti-Hallucination Training** · *Core Member* · 2025–present
  * Fine-tuned LLMs with GRPO; designed QuCo-Infigram factuality reward using entity frequency and co-occurrence verification, eliminating the need for NLI models
  * Constructed a local Wikipedia Infini-gram index (6.4M articles) enabling millisecond-level offline queries

* **Causal MD: End-to-End Causal Discovery for Protein Conformational Transitions** · *Core Member* · 2025–present
  * Designed an end-to-end differentiable framework based on CRL, recovering time-varying latent causal structures from molecular dynamics trajectories to identify key residues driving protein loop transitions
  * Integrated protein 3D spatial priors (contact map constraints) with temporal structure

* **Semantic and Goal-Driven Dexterous Hand Manipulation** · *B.Sc. Thesis* · 2024–2025
  * Reproduced the Text2HOI three-stage framework, matching reported performance on H2O, GRAB, and ARCTIC datasets
  * Proposed a Shadow Hand → MANO cross-embodiment retargeting algorithm; joint training with GraspM3 dataset improved Physical Realism to 0.897 and reduced penetration volume by ~50%

## Competitions
